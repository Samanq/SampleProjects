# Getting Start with React

## Summary
React is a **JavaSrippt library** for building user interfaces.

There are three important concepts in react.
### Components
* Components are like functions, they receive objects and return an UI.
* Componenst are reusable. 
* Components can caontain other components.
* Can be used as regular html element like this <Component / >
* Components can have a **private state** that can hold data that may change over the life cycle of the component.
* Componest's name must start with **capital letter**.

There are two types of components.
* **Function Component**
* **Class Component**

### Reactive Updates
* When the input of a component changes, the output could be changes as well.

### Virtual views in memory
* Generating HTML using JavaScript.
* React uses the virtual dom to compare versions of the UI in memory before it acts on them.
