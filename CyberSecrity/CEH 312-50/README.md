## Types of Attacks

### Passive Attacks
In Passive (sniffing or Eavesdropping), attacks, attackers listen to the traffic.

### Active Attacks
Attackers usually exploit a vulnerability or cause harm to the system like disrupting the communication. We can mention attack like, **DOS**, **Man-in-the-middle**, **session hijacking** and **SQL injection** attacks.

### Close-in Attacks
Attackers are usually close to the target. we can mention attacks like, **Shoulder surfing**, **dumpster diving** and also social engineering.

### Insider attacks
These attack come from the inside the organization.<br>
These attacks can be done by, stealing physical devices, planting malware, using backdoors and keylogger.

### Distribution attacks
The attackers, temper a software or hardware at its source before the installation.

## Cyber Kill Chain Methodology 

### Reconnaissance 
Gathering information about the victim. information like, network and system information.<br>
Attackers are **passive** in this step.

### Weaponization
Going through gathered information and identify the vulnerabilities and prepare the tools and the payload. 

### Delivery
Delivering the payload via email, link, usb drop, etc.

### Exploitation
Somebody runs the delivered payload. 

### Installation
Installing the malicious payload.

### Command and Control phase
Creating a two way channel between attacker and victim system.

### Action on Objectives
Start stealing data or harming the victim's system. The victim system can also be used as a lunching point to perform other attacks to other victims.
